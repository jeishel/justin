        <p>The past few weeks have been tough, and I know it hasn't been easy for us. We've been through a lot of problems, more than I ever imagined we would face. But, through all of it, there’s one thing I need you to understand. I’ve never once changed how I feel about you. Not a single time. Despite all the ups and downs, the hard conversations, the silence, and the frustration, my love for you has stayed constant. It’s as strong now as it was in the very beginning, and it’s going to stay that way, forever. I can’t imagine it any other way.</p>
        <p>From the moment we met, I never could’ve known how much you would come to mean to me. I never could’ve predicted how deep my feelings would grow for you, how quickly you’d become the most important part of my life. But, now, when I look at you, I realize just how much I’ve fallen in love with you. And it’s not just because of the way you look or the things you do, it’s because of who you are. It’s the way you make me feel, the way you’ve always been there for me, even when things were hard. I want you to know that I love you with everything I have. And even though we’re facing all these problems, nothing changes that.</p>
        <p>You’ve brought so much light into my life, and I can’t help but think about how much better my world is because you’re in it. I want to show you, every single day, just how much you mean to me. I want to remind you that you are so special, not just to me, but in general. You have a way about you that no one else does. The way you care, the way you listen, the way you make me laugh even when I’m feeling down, it all means more to me than I can put into words. Sometimes, I feel like I’m not good enough to deserve someone as amazing as you, but every time I see you smile, I’m reminded that I am. I’m so lucky that you chose me, and I’ll never take that for granted.</p>
        <p>I wish I could make you see yourself the way I see you, truly. Because, in my eyes, you are perfect. Every little thing about you is a part of what makes you so incredible. And when I say that there’s no one who can compare to you, I really mean it. There isn’t another person in this world who could ever come close to being as perfect for me as you are. I don’t need anyone else because you are exactly who I’ve been waiting for. You are the person I want to spend every day with, the one I want to share my dreams with, and the one I want to build a future with.</p>
        <p>I know we’ve had our share of misunderstandings and disagreements, but I want you to know that nothing, absolutely nothing, will ever change the way I feel about you. I know it’s easy to feel discouraged when things get hard, to wonder if maybe we’re not meant to be, but I can promise you that I’m not going anywhere. You are the best thing that’s ever been mine, and I would choose you over and over again, no matter what. I want to show you just how much you mean to me, how thankful I am that you’re in my life, and how much I love you.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, it’s hard to put everything into words, but every time I look at you, every time we talk, every time I think about you, I’m reminded of how special you are. I want you to feel that. I want you to know that no matter what happens, I will always love you, from the very beginning to today, and for the rest of our lives. There’s no one else I could imagine spending my time with. You are my safe place, my best friend, my everything. You’re the one who has my heart, and I can’t wait to keep giving it to you, every day, for as long as I live.</p>
        <p>No matter how many challenges come our way, I want you to know that I believe in us. I believe in what we have, and I believe in what we’re going to become. We’ve been through a lot already, and we’ve come out stronger. And we’ll keep fighting for each other, no matter what, because you are worth it. We are worth it. I will never stop loving you. I will never stop showing you how much you mean to me. And I will never stop believing that we are exactly where we’re meant to be, together. You are the best thing that has ever happened to me, and I’ll never take that for granted. I love you more than you could ever know, and I always will.</p>
